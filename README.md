Game Web App using Angular 1.0, Express.js, mangodb, sql and node.js made as a university project.
You need to connect by login to its account or creating an account (stored in sql database). Once connected, you can start a quizz with the parameters chosen. The quizz is fetched randomly in the mangodb database and each question is timed. When you finish the quizz, you get a score and you can challenge a connected friend in your friendlist. If he accept, he will get the same quizz.
